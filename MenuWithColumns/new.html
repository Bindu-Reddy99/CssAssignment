            <strong>Quantum Entanglement</strong>&nbsp;is a Green function which
            is essentially a way of deriving covariantcomplex valued quantities
            from a, frame dependent expression, i.e., the unitaryevolution
            operator. In QET, the Green operator is a covariant operator
            valuedfunction, delivering the same quantities directly, as matrix
            elements. Increasedelegance is not the only beneﬁt from this
            transformation. The possibly mostimportant consequence is that the
            dimensionality of time is irrelevant in thisconstruction. Additional
            dimensions of time can now be introduced as easily asspace
            dimensions<br />
