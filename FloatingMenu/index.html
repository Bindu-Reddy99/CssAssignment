        Quantized properties: Certain properties, such as position, speed and
        color, can sometimes only occur in specific, set amounts, much like a
        dial that "clicks" from number to number. This challenged a fundamental
        assumption of classical mechanics, which said that such properties
        should exist on a smooth, continuous spec describe the idea that some
        properties "clicked" like a dial with specific settings, scientists
        coined the word "quantized."

        Particles of light: Light can sometimes behave as a particle. This was
        initially met with harsh criticism, as it ran contrary to 200 years of
        experiments showing that light behaved as a wave; much like ripples on
        the surface of a calm lake. Light behaves similarly in that it bounces
        off walls and bends around corners, and that the crests and troughs of
        the wave can add up or cancel out. Added wave crests result in brighter
        light, while waves that cancel out produce darkness.

        It results in what may appear to be some very strange conclusions about
        the physical world. At the scale of atoms and electrons, many of the
        equations of classical mechanics, which describe how things move at
        everyday sizes and speeds, cease to be useful. In classical mechanics,
        objects exist in a specific place at a specific time. However, in
        quantum mechanics, objects instead exist in a haze of probability

        In 1900, German physicist Max Planck sought to explain the distribution
        of colors emitted over the spectrum in the glow of red-hot and white-hot
        objects, such as light-bulb filaments. When making physical sense of the
        equation he had derived to describe this distribution, Planck realized
        it implied that combinations of only certain colors (albeit a great
        number of them) were emitted, specifically those that were whole-number
        multiples of some base value. Somehow, colors were quantized!
